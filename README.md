# public-gateway-checker

Checks which public IPFS gateways are online or not.

NOTE: All of these (except gateway.ipfs.io and ipfs.io) are hosted by third-parties and should be treated as such.

You can view the website via Github Pages: https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/

A CLI version `ipfg` is available here: https://github.com/JayBrown/Tools/tree/master/ipfg
